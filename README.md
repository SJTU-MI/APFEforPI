Automated physical feature engineering for polymer informatics (APFEforPI), which has been utilized for the exploitation of high thermal conductivity amorphous polymers
## Description
Automated physical feature engineering for polymer informatics, including descriptor generation, statistical filtering, and machine learning model selection. The obtained optimized descriptors are available for the description of polymers to enable the construction of machine learning models with desired properties. It has been combined with high-throughput calculations to explore high thermal conductivity polymers and to understand the underlying physical mechanisms.  Please refer to our work "Informatics Algorithm-Assisted Exploration of High Thermal Conductivity Amorphous Polymers Using Automated Physical Feature Engineering and Symbolic Regression" for additional details.
