# APFEforPI
Automated physical feature engineering for polymer informatics (APFEforPI), which has been utilized for the exploitation of high thermal conductivity amorphous polymers.
## Description
Automated physical feature engineering for polymer informatics, including descriptor generation, statistical filtering, and machine learning model selection. The obtained optimized descriptors are available for the description of polymers to enable the construction of machine learning models with desired properties. It has been combined with high-throughput calculations to explore high thermal conductivity polymers and to understand the underlying physical mechanisms.  Please refer to our work "High-Throughput Screening of Amorphous Polymers with High Intrinsic Thermal Conductivity via Automated Physical Feature Engineering" for additional details.

## Installation
### Files loading and environment setup:

To download, clone this repository:<br>
````
git clone https://github.com/SJTU-MI/APFEforPI.git
````

To run most code in this repository, the relevant anaconda environment can be installed from environment.yml. To build this environment, run：<br>
````
cd ./APFEforPI
conda env create -f environment.yml

## Datasets

The training dataset and the screening datasets in this work are described in the following Table. We utilized 1051 polymer data with calculated TC by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations as the training dataset A, which was sampled by polymer types from PoLyInfo database. Dataset B was collected manually from the PoLyInfo database and retained after de-duplication with dataset A. Dataset C is a specific dataset, and all polymers are polyimides, which were formed by dianhydride and diamine/diisocyanate from PubChem.
